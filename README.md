## Overview
So this was a challenge I built to refresh me building sites with only the basics: HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is an e-commerce landing page for a sneakers company advertising their latest product: The Fall Special. The website allowed users to view the product, interact with the different images and even add products to cart to checkout.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it
- Interact with a website that is optimal, fast and data-saving

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
> Used only basic tools and languages so the website could be optimal
### What I learned

Optimizing code to be fast, high performing and user-friendly was something I'm proud to have learned during this project.
Identifying and deferring under-the-fold CSS and JS, while making the critical CSS and JS needed always ready was a new thing the project helped me understand.
If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
So I discovered I'm not really comfortable with the same optimization I learnt a great deal of while building this project so I'll probably learn more about it before diving in my next project two days from now.

### Useful resources

- [Resource on deferring render blocking resources]https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/) - This helped me for inlining critical resources and the understanding of how to know which parts of code should be critical or not. I really liked its pattern of explaining and will surely use it while trying to learn more about code optimization.
